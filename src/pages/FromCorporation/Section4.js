            Our Texas incorporation package includes free basic mail
            forwarding—up to 10 regular mail scans per year. If you don’t expect
            to receive much non-state mail for your Texas corporation, this is a
            great option. Just as with any official mail we receive for your
            business, we’ll send you a notification when you have a new document
            to view in your account. For business owners who need a completely
            unique Texas business address, we have 3 full-service mail
            forwarding options you can add at checkout, both of which include a
            newly created suite number.
