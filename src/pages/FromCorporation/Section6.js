            Although LLC Operating Agreements are not required in every state,
            it’s a smart business move to have one. This legally binding
            document provides clear and concise definitions of all ownership
            terms and rules or management decisions. An operating agreement
            protects owners’ personal assets and outlines ownership percentages,
            responsibilities, voting power, and a succession plan if an owner
            decides to leave the business.
            <br/> Having an Operating Agreement can
            prevent any miscommunication and resolve any conflicts between
            members. It is not required by law to file an LLC Operating
            Agreement with the Secretary of State, so once all parties have
            agreed upon the terms and signed it, it’s advisable to keep the
            document safe and secure with other important paperwork.
